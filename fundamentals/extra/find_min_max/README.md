# Largest and Smallest Number Finder  

## Program Description  
This C++ program reads three integer values from the user and determines the largest and smallest numbers among them. If all numbers are equal, it outputs that information.  

## Functionality  
1. Prompts the user to enter three integers (`A`, `B`, `C`).  
2. Checks if all three numbers are equal and outputs `"All numbers are equal"`.  
3. Determines and prints the largest number.  
4. Determines and prints the smallest number.  

## Error Handling  
- Ensures valid numerical input for all three integers.  
- Handles cases where all numbers are equal.  

## Example input  
Enter A, B, C  
5 8 2

## Example output  
Largest number: 8  
Smallest number: 2
