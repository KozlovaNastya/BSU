# Mathematical Expression Calculator

## Program Description
This C++ program calculates a complex mathematical expression using nested square roots and factorial-like multiplications.

## Functionality
1. Reads an integer input `x` from the user.
2. Computes a recursive-like function `C(sum)`, which involves:
   - Squaring numbers from 2 to 5.
   - Applying square root operations.
   - Multiplying by an increasing factorial-like sequence.
3. Prints the result of `C(sqrt(1 + x))`.
4. Prints a second mathematical expression with nested square roots and multiplications.

## Error Handling
- Ensures the square root function receives non-negative values using `fabs(x)`.
- Handles integer input correctly.

## Example input
5


## Example output
A numerical result (depends on computation)  
Another numerical result (depends on computation)
