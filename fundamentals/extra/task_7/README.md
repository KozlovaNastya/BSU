# Fibonacci Sequence Generator  

## Program Description  
This C++ program generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence based on user input.  

## Functionality  
1. Prompts the user to enter the number of Fibonacci sequence repetitions (`n`).  
2. Initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers as `1`.  
3. Uses a loop to compute and print the next `n-2` Fibonacci numbers.  
4. Outputs the full Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th term.  

## Error Handling  
- Ensures valid numerical input for `n`.  
- Handles cases where `n` is less than 2 by printing only the available Fibonacci numbers.  

## Example input  
Enter the number of repetitions  
6

## Example output  
1  
1  
2  
3  
5  
8
