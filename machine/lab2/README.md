## Assembler Cycles

This C++ program reads an integer input from the user, counts the occurrences of each digit, and determines the most frequently occurring digit using inline assembly.

### Functionality

1. Reads an integer `N` from the user.

2. Converts negative numbers to positive.

3. Counts the occurrences of each digit (0-9).

4. Determines the most common digit.

5. Displays the most common digit.

### Error Handling

- Ensures the input is a valid integer.

- Handles negative numbers by converting them to positive.

### Example Input

`Enter number: 1223334444`

### Example Output

`Most common digit: 4`
