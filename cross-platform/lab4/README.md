# Equation Solver Program

## Description

This program is designed to solve and manage two types of equations:

1. **Quadratic Equation** (axÂ² + bx + c = 0)
2. **Linear Equation** (ax + b = 0)

The program performs various tasks such as solving the equations, writing solutions to a file, checking for solutions, and sorting the equations based on their coefficients.

### Features:
- Input quadratic and linear equations.
- Solve the equations and print solutions.
- Save the output to a file called `DATA.txt`.
- Display equations that have no solutions or infinite solutions.
- Sort equations by their leading coefficients and by the second coefficient for linear equations.
- Check special cases for quadratic equations, like having a negative determinant or being a perfect square.
- Display linear equations where the leading coefficient is smaller than the second coefficient and sort them based on the second coefficient.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need:
- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher (for example, GCC or MSVC).

## Compilation
